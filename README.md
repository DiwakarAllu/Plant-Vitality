## Project Title: 
Plant Disease Prediction and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Android 
and Machine Learning. - Plant-Vitality ðŸŒ±

## Description:
The objective of this project is to develop an Android application that can 
accurately predict plant diseases based on user-submitted images and provide 
appropriate fertilizer recommendations to help users effectively manage plant 
health. The project will leverage machine learning techniques to train a model for 
disease classification and develop an intuitive Android interface for users to 
interact with the system. It offers real-time image recognition for common plant diseases, 
along with care tips and recommendations. The app also features an integrated chatbot for instant support.

## Key Features:
- Image Recognition for  Plant Diseases
- Real-time Chatbot for Plant Care Support
- Plant Care Tips and Best Practices
- Fertilizer recomendation

## Technologies Used:
- Android Studio
- SVM and InceptionV3 Algorithms
- TensorFlow (ML framework)
- BrainShop API (backend service for chatbot)
